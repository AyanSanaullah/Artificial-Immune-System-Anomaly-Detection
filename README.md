# Artificial Immune System for Synthetic Data Anomaly Detection

This repository contains an implementation of an **Artificial Immune System (AIS)** for detecting anomalies in synthetic datasets. Inspired by the biological immune system, this project simulates immune mechanisms to identify unusual patterns and outliers in data. It serves as a demonstration of AIS principles in computational anomaly detection.

## Project Overview

Artificial Immune Systems are bio-inspired algorithms modeled after the immune system's ability to detect and respond to harmful pathogens. In this project, AIS principles are applied to synthetic datasets, highlighting their versatility and effectiveness in anomaly detection tasks.

### Features
- Simulates AIS mechanisms such as antigen recognition and immune response.
- Generates synthetic datasets for benchmarking anomaly detection.
- Visualizes anomaly detection results with clear plots and metrics.
- Provides a modular, reusable implementation for educational and research purposes.


## Requirements
This project requires the following dependencies:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Install the dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

1. **Generate Synthetic Data**  
   Use the built-in data generation tools in the notebook to create datasets with known anomalies.

2. **Run AIS Model**  
   Execute the notebook to simulate AIS mechanisms and detect anomalies in the synthetic data.

3. **Visualize Results**  
   Analyze the visualizations and performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the AIS approach.

## Sample Workflow

1. **Synthetic Data Generation**  
   Simulate datasets with adjustable noise, anomaly levels, and distributions.

2. **AIS-Based Anomaly Detection**  
   Apply AIS mechanisms such as clonal selection and negative selection.

3. **Evaluation**  
   Use metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
